Hello! I'm Lucas R. Schiavetti and I'm an earth scientist, currently working as a contractor researcher for Unicamp.

My main interests include petrology, tectonics, crustal evolution and solving geology problems with programming and data science. I was able to publish **a paper** on high-grade metamorphism and now I'm developing a data tool to help the dating of carbonates to the oil industry. 


Cheers!
