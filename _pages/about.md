Hello! I'm Lucas R. Schiavetti and I'm an earth scientist. I hold an undegraduate degree from the University of SÃ£o Paulo and a Masters degree from the University of Campinas, focused on petro(chrono)logy, crustal evolution and tectonics.
The first paper with my masters data was [published](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jmg.70007) on _Journal of Metamorphic Geology_.

After workig with data science for a while, I'm now a full-time researcher at Unicamp building a data tool to improve carbonate geochronology for the oil industry.

Cheers!
