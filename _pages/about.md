I'm a brazilian geologist currently working with machine learning applied to geochronology.

I hold a Masters degree from the University of Campinas in petrochronology of metamorphic rocks. Before that, I got my geology undergrad at the University of SÃ£o Paulo. I was also able to study abroad at Western Washington Univesity (US) and at the Univeristy of Otago (New Zealand).

My interests include petrochronology, tectonics and solve geological problems with spftware.
