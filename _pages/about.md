I'm a geologist currently trying to improve carbonate geochronology methods for the oil industry.

I hold a Masters degree from the University of Campinas in **metamophic petrology, geochronology and thermodynamic modelling**, which led to the [publication](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jmg.70007) of my first paper on _Journal of Metamorphic Geology_. Before that, I got my geology undergrad from the University of SÃ£o Paulo.

My interests include metamorphic petro(chrono)logy, crustal evolution and tectonics; and solve geological problems with code and data science.

This website contains info about my work, previous contributions and things that I randomly feel like sharing..

Cheers!
